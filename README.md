MediaWiki Bootstrap
===================

A MediaWiki skin and companion extension to integrate Twitter Bootstrap.

This is still in development but more or less useable. Right now consider it a skin to use as a base for further development of a custom MediaWiki skin.

Add ```require('skins/Boostrap/Boostrap.setup.php')``` to your config. It won't work without it.
